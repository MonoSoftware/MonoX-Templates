                        <p>
                            <strong>Full support for the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e0s9t4ck.aspx" target="_blank">ASP.NET Web Parts Framework</a></strong><br />
                            Web Parts Framework includes a set of controls and services that specifically target the growing demand for Web portal creation, including support for personalization, membership, communication and other infrastructural tasks. MonoX is built on top of the standard Web Part API.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Commitment to standards</strong><br />
                            MonoX renders XHTML compliant code and enables users to develop fully standards-compliant portals that will work reliably on different platforms.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Unlimited design flexibility</strong><br />
                            Developers can create user interface templates without any limitations, using their favorite approach (tables, DIVs, CSS, ...). ASP.NET master pages, themes and templates are fully supported.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Open API</strong><br />
                            MonoX allows developers to access all of its back-end functionality through a comprehensive set of fully documented methods and events.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa479030.aspx" target="_blank">Provider-based</a> architecture</strong><br />
                            An ASP.NET provider is a software module that provides a uniform interface between a service and a data source. Providers abstract physical storage media, in much the same way that device drivers abstract physical hardware devices. MonoX uses the provider model extensively, making it easy to add new functionality and interface with other ASP.NET applications.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Support for localization</strong><br />
                            All content and user interface elements can be localized at run time using only browser-based administrative tools. In addition to the standard .NET localization infrastructure, MonoX can store all localization resources in a portal database.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Advanced module communication</strong><br />
                            Developers can design sophisticated and elaborate Web part communication scenarios using the module communication support.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Development flexibility</strong><br />
                            All MonoX Web parts are in essence standard ASP.NET user controls. This allows developers to leverage their experience without the need to learn about new APIs and development environments. Controls are registered with the portal just by placing them in the module gallery folder. Additionally, there is an actual underlying file for each page, making it easy to customize the behavior of each portal page just like it is an ordinary ASPX page.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Multi-portal environments</strong><br />
                            Unlimited number of portals can be served from a single portal database.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Advanced personalization infrastructure</strong><br />
                            MonoX builds upon the personalization system that is integrated into ASP.NET 2.0, enabling users to personalize their working environment on both user and shared levels.

                            MonoX administrators can fine-tune the caching system on both page and Web part-level to reduce the access time and increase application responsiveness.

                            MonoX can completely remove the contents of the ViewState hidden form field. It practically means that your page will be much "lighter" in terms of size and load times, as ViewState hidden field can hold tens of kilobytes of data even in moderately complex applications. All this is possible without loosing any of the ViewState-related functionality.
